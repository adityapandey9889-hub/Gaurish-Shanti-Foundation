<!-- OUR STORY -->
<section class="about-section">
  <div class="about-container">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Gaurish Shanti Foundation was not built from ambition — it was built from responsibility.
      It began with a simple yet powerful belief: that real change does not come from words,
      but from consistent action rooted in compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In communities where opportunity feels distant and hope often fades quietly,
      we chose to stand present. We chose to serve. What started as small acts of support
      slowly transformed into structured initiatives that now touch lives across education,
      healthcare, environmental sustainability, and social empowerment.

<!-- OUR PURPOSE -->
<section class="about-section light">
  <div class="about-container">
    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Our purpose is simple yet profound — to empower individuals and strengthen communities.
      We believe that dignity, knowledge, health, and opportunity are not privileges,
      but rights every human deserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through plantation drives, medical outreach programs, educational support,
      and women empowerment initiatives, we aim to build a society that stands
      not on charity, but on shared responsibility.
